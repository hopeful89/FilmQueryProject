## Lessons Learned
  This project introduced a lot of new and moving parts.  Use of JDBC and MySQL were all new to me and it was a joy to correct mistakes and get the program running.  The best part of this project for me was learning about relational databases and formulating queries.  I now understand how to use Java to get a connection, prepare my statement, and display requested data.
